# Test Microflows Skill

This skill guides you through writing and running MDL-based microflow tests using `mxcli test`.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this when:
- The user asks to test microflow logic (not UI/pages)
- The user wants to verify that microflows return correct values
- The user wants to validate entity creation, updates, or control flow
- You have generated MDL microflows and want to verify they work at runtime
- The user asks for unit tests or integration tests on business logic

For **UI/page testing** (widget rendering, form interactions, browser tests), see the `test-app` skill instead.

## Prerequisites

- Mendix project with microflows to test
- A way to run the app — **either** of:
  - `--local` (no Docker): mxcli boots the runtime itself, the same way
    `mxcli run --local` does. This is the only option in a container without a
    Docker daemon, which includes Claude Code web sessions.
  - Docker: stack initialized (`mxcli docker init -p app.mpr`) and the app
    buildable (`mxcli docker build -p app.mpr`).

```bash
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --local     # no daemon needed
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr             # Docker
```

`--local` uses its own ports (app 8081, admin 8091) and its own
`<project>_test` database, so a `mxcli run --local` dev loop can keep serving the
same project while the tests run — the tests never write into the database you
are looking at in the browser. The database is created on first use.

### Constants

A `--local` run boots the app with the **same constant values `mxcli run --local`
uses**: the project configuration's shared overrides, layered over each
constant's default. It prints what it applied before the run:

```
Applying 1 constant value(s):
  MyModule.ApiKey  configuration "Default"
```

Pass `--configuration <name>` to pick one when the project has several and none
is called `Default` (it refuses to guess rather than run production's values by
accident). `--attach` takes neither flag: it runs against an app someone else
booted and inherits **that app's** constants.

To set a value for one run without touching the project, use `--constant`
(repeatable). It wins over the configuration and is never written to the model:

```bash
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --local --constant MyModule.ApiKey=sk-test-123
```

A name the project does not declare is **refused**, before anything boots — the
runtime silently ignores a value for a constant that does not exist, so a typo
would otherwise be reported as applied and do nothing.

The value is visible in shell history and in `ps`. That is fine for a throwaway
test value and wrong for a real secret.

This is worth knowing when a test asserts on something a constant feeds. Before
this was wired up, `--local` ran with each constant's *default* while `--attach`
ran with the configuration's, so the same suite could pass one way and fail the
other with nothing in the output to explain it.

For a secret that has to **persist** across runs, use the machine store:

```bash
mxcli constant set MyModule.ApiKey 'sk-live-...' -p app.mpr
mxcli constant list -p app.mpr          # values from the store are masked
mxcli constant unset MyModule.ApiKey -p app.mpr
```

It writes `<project>/.mxcli/constants.json` (mode 0600), adds `.mxcli/` to the
project's `.gitignore` if missing, and then **asks git whether the path is
really ignored** — refusing to write the value if it is not. It beats the
configuration and loses to `--constant`.

By default the new value takes effect at the next boot. Add `--apply` to push it
into a `mxcli run --local` that is already up, without restarting it:

```bash
mxcli constant set MyModule.ApiKey 'sk-live-...' -p app.mpr --apply
```

That is two admin calls, not one: `update_configuration` is *staged* — the
running app keeps its old values and the call still answers success — and only
the following `reload_model` applies them. mxcli does both. It cannot confirm
the result, because the admin API has no way to read a constant back, so it says
so and points you at the app itself.

This is mxcli's own store, not Mendix's. Mendix's private configuration values
are encrypted per user account by Studio Pro from 10.9, so nothing headless can
read or write them. See `docs/11-proposals/PROPOSAL_constant_values.md`.

## Test File Formats

### `.test.mdl` — Pure MDL Tests

Test blocks separated by `/`, each with a javadoc comment containing test annotations:

```sql
/**
 * @test String concatenation
 * @expect $result = 'John Doe'
 */
$result = call microflow MyModule.ConcatNames(
  FirstName = 'John', LastName = 'Doe'
);
/

/**
 * @test Arithmetic operation
 * @expect $result = 50
 */
$result = call microflow MyModule.Multiply(A = 10, B = 5);
/
```

### `.test.md` — Markdown Specification

Tests embedded in documentation as `mdl-test` fenced code blocks:

~~~markdown
# MyModule Specification

## string Operations

The ConcatNames microflow joins first and last name.

```mdl-test
/** @expect $result = 'John Doe' */
$result = call microflow MyModule.ConcatNames(
  FirstName = 'John', LastName = 'Doe'
);
```
~~~

The markdown format turns your tests into living documentation.

## Annotations

| Tag | Purpose | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `@test` | Test name (required) | `@test string concatenation` |
| `@expect` | Assert a Mendix condition | `@expect $result = 'John Doe'` |
| `@expect` | Assert an entity attribute | `@expect $product/Name = 'TestProduct'` |
| `@expect` | Assert with a built-in | `@expect length($result) = 81` |
| `@verify` | OQL post-condition on the database | `@verify select count(*) as n from Mod.E = 1` |
| `@throws` | Expect error | `@throws 'validation failed'` |
| `@cleanup` | Rollback strategy | `@cleanup rollback` (default) or `@cleanup none` |

### A test run leaves the project byte-identical

`mxcli test` injects an `MxTest` module, builds, runs, and takes the injection
back out. When cleanup succeeds the project file is restored **byte-for-byte**,
so `git status` is clean afterwards and a CI step of the form "run the tests,
then assert the tree is clean" holds.

This needs saying because restoring the *model* is not enough. Every unit write
stamps a fresh UUID into the `.mpr`'s `_Transaction` bookkeeping row, and the
inject/remove cycle relays SQLite's pages, so the file differs even once its
content matches again. Version control compares bytes, and a `.mpr` diff is
opaque — there is no cheap way to tell a bookkeeping GUID from a real model edit,
which is what made the spurious modification expensive rather than merely untidy.

The restore is declined, deliberately, when **cleanup failed** or when the
`mprcontents/` tree changed during the run. In both cases the project is not in
the state the snapshot describes, and putting the old file back would turn a
visible, harmless discrepancy into an invisible, misleading one.

### `@expect` — any Mendix condition, and nothing it cannot evaluate

An `@expect` is **a Mendix expression that must evaluate to true**, not a fixed
`$var = value` shape. Anything the Mendix expression engine accepts works:

```mdl
@expect $result = 'John Doe'                       -- equality
@expect $product/Name != 'Widget'                  -- inequality (<> also accepted)
@expect length($result) = 81                       -- built-in functions
@expect find($result, '0') >= 0                    -- any comparison operator
@expect substring($result, 0, 9) = substring($result, 9, 18)
@expect find($result, '0') >= 0 and $count > 3     -- and / or / not(...)
@expect $status = MyModule.Status.Open             -- enumeration values
```

`<>` is accepted in the annotation and rewritten to `!=` on the way to the
model, because Mendix's expression engine rejects the `<>` spelling (CE0117).

**An assertion the runner cannot compile is an ERROR, never a pass.** Unknown
functions, wrong arity, unbalanced parentheses and expressions that evaluate to
a value rather than a condition are all rejected by name:

```
ERROR  a self-evident falsehood
       @expect randomInt($result) = 1: randomInt() is not a Mendix expression
       function at column 1 ("randomInt")
```

This is the one rule the annotation is built around. A test framework that
cannot evaluate an assertion has exactly one safe behaviour, and passing is not
it — an earlier version matched only `$var = <literal>` and silently discarded
every other line, so `@expect 1 = 2` reported PASS.

**A failure reports what came back**, not just what was wanted, whenever the
observed value's type is pinned down by the assertion itself:

```
FAIL  the board is 81 squares
      expected length($result) = 81, actual: 27
```

The value is omitted rather than guessed when neither side of the comparison
establishes a type (`@expect $a = $b`), because Mendix's expression engine is
typed and a wrong guess would break the build instead of the test.

### `@verify` — asserting on what the microflow wrote

`@expect` can only see what a microflow **returned**. Most Mendix microflows are
side effects, so `@verify` is how you assert on the rows one left behind: an OQL
query, a comparison, and the value it must satisfy.

```mdl
/**
 * @test dealing a board writes 81 cells
 * @cleanup none
 * @expect $result = 'ok'
 * @verify select count(*) as n from Sudoku.Cell = 81
 * @verify select count(*) as n from Sudoku.Cell where Value = 0 > 0
 */
$result = CALL MICROFLOW Sudoku.ACT_DealGame();
/
```

The query runs against the app **after** the microflow returns, over the same
admin API `mxcli oql` uses. Three rules follow from that, and each is enforced
rather than left to trip you up:

- **`@cleanup none` is required.** `rollback` is the default, and it undoes the
  test's writes before the query could see them — so a `@verify` on a rollback
  test is **refused**, not run against the pre-test state.
- **The query must return exactly one row and one column.** Comparing a table to
  a literal would mean guessing which cell was meant. Aggregate it
  (`select count(*)`), or select one attribute of one row.
- **The expected value is a literal** — a number, a quoted string, `true`/`false`
  or `empty`. It is split off at the **last** comparison operator outside quotes
  and parentheses, so a `where Value = 5` in the query is left alone.
- **Every selected column needs a name.** Mendix's OQL rejects a bare
  `select count(*)` with *"All OQL select columns must have a name"*, so write
  `select count(*) as n`. That comes back as an ERROR, not a pass.

Operators: `=`, `!=` (`<>` accepted), `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. Numbers compare
numerically even though the runtime returns them as strings.

**A `@verify` that cannot be evaluated is an ERROR, never a pass** — an unknown
entity, malformed OQL, a non-scalar result, or something that was never a query:

```
ERROR  dealing a board writes 81 cells
       @verify select count(*) as n from Sudoku.NoSuch = 1: OQL error: Unknown entity
```

and a false one fails with the value that came back:

```
FAIL  dealing a board writes 81 cells
      expected select count(*) as n from Sudoku.Cell = 81, actual: 27
```

`@verify` needs the test endpoint, so it runs under `--local` (the default) and
`--attach`. The Docker / `--legacy-runner` path **refuses** a suite using it:
its tests execute during boot, so there is no point at which to query the app.

### A test that asserts nothing says so

Every result line carries what the test actually checked, and a run that
contains a vacuous test calls it out:

```
  PASS  the board is 81 squares (6ms, 2 assertions)
  PASS  asserts nothing at all (4ms, no assertions)
------------------------------------------------------------
1 test(s) asserted nothing beyond "did not throw". Run with
--require-assertions to make that an error.
```

A test with no `@expect` and no `@throws` is a **smoke test** — it reports only
that the body did not throw. That is a legitimate thing to write, so it still
passes by default. What it may not do is look identical to a test with six
assertions: after `@expect` started failing closed, the cheapest way back to a
green suite is to delete the assertion, and that must not read as a repair.

`--require-assertions` turns every vacuous test into an ERROR, for a project
that has decided each test must assert. The JUnit report carries the count as a
`<property name="assertions">` per case, and `classname` now identifies the
source file, so a failure in a multi-file run says where it lives.

### `@cleanup` — what happens to a test's data

**`rollback` is the default**, so by default a test's database writes do not
survive it. The endpoint opens a transaction around the call and rolls it back
afterwards, including when the test throws.

```mdl
/**
 * @test creating an order does not leak
 * @expect $result = 'ok'
 */
$result = CALL MICROFLOW Sales.CreateOrder(Amount = 100);
/

/**
 * @test seed data the next test needs
 * @cleanup none
 */
$result = CALL MICROFLOW Sales.SeedCatalogue();
/
```

Use `@cleanup none` when the writes are the point — seeding a fixture, or
inspecting the result in the running app afterwards.

Two things worth knowing:

- **`--local` only.** Rollback needs the test endpoint, which owns the context
  the test runs in. The Docker / `--legacy-runner` path executes tests inside
  the after-startup action and has no such seam, so it always commits.
- **A rollback that fails is reported, loudly.** The run prints a `WARNING` per
  affected test and a summary line, because the alternative — data left behind
  while the suite still says PASS — is the failure mode this annotation exists
  to prevent. `--verbose` tags every test with `[rolled back]`, `[committed]` or
  `[ROLLBACK FAILED]`.

A misspelled strategy (`@cleanup rollbak`) is a **parse error**, not a silent
fallback to committing.

Rollback matters most under `--attach`, where the database is the one your dev
app is using.

## Running Tests

```bash
# run tests from a file
mxcli test tests/microflows.test.mdl -p app.mpr

# run all tests in a directory
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr

# list tests without executing
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --list

# Output JUnit xml for CI
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --junit results.xml

# Skip build (reuse existing deployment)
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --skip-build

# Verbose output (show all runtime logs)
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --verbose
```

---

## How It Works

There are two mechanisms. `--local` uses the **test endpoint**; Docker uses the
older **after-startup microflow** pattern.

### `--local`: the test endpoint

1. Parses test files and extracts test blocks with annotations
2. Records the project's current after-startup microflow, and whether an `MxTest`
   module already exists
3. Generates **one `MxTest.Test_<id>` microflow per test**, plus a Java action
   that registers an HTTP endpoint, and points after-startup at a microflow that
   registers it and then **chains your own after-startup microflow** —
   **no test runs during startup**
4. Builds and boots the app once
5. Invokes each test by name over HTTP; each returns its own verdict in the
   response
6. Restores the original after-startup setting and removes everything generated
7. Outputs results (console, JUnit XML)

Two consequences worth knowing when reading a failing run:

- **A test that throws fails only itself.** It is reported as `ERROR` with the
  root-cause message, and the next test still runs. Under the after-startup
  mechanism an uncaught error ends the whole flow — and because that flow *is*
  the startup action, it also fails the boot.
- **Results are returned, not scraped**, so a test cannot be lost to log
  buffering or a runtime that stopped echoing to the console.

Each test is a separate microflow with its own variable scope, so `$result` in
one test never collides with `$result` in another.

#### Your app's after-startup microflow still runs

The generated startup flow registers the endpoint and then calls the project's
own after-startup microflow, so tests see the app in the state it actually boots
into — a loaded cache, seeded reference data, whatever your app does. The run
says which happened:

```
After-startup set to MxTest.RegisterEndpoint (registers the endpoint; runs no tests, then runs your MyModule.ASU_Startup)
```

Pass `--skip-app-startup` when you want an empty, deterministic baseline
instead — the app seeds demo data and your tests assert on counts, say:

```
After-startup set to MxTest.RegisterEndpoint (… --skip-app-startup, so MyModule.ASU_Startup will NOT run)
```

This is why a suite behaves the same under `--local` and `--attach`. Before it
chained, `--local` ran with the app's startup logic suppressed, and a suite that
depended on startup state passed under `--attach` and failed under `--local` for
reasons unrelated to the code.

One thing rollback does **not** cover: whatever the startup microflow writes
happens at boot, outside any test's transaction, so `@cleanup rollback` does not
undo it. Under `--local` that lands in the scratch `<project>_test` database;
under `--attach` your app wrote it at its own boot regardless.

#### `--watch`: keep the runtime warm

```bash
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --local --watch
```

The first run pays the cold boot; after that the runtime and the build server
stay up, and the suite re-runs on every change — to a test file **or** to the
project's model. Measured on an 11.13.0 app:

| | |
|---|---|
| First run (cold boot) | ~30s |
| Edit a test → verdict on screen | **~2s** |
| Edit a microflow → verdict on screen | **~2s** |
| The tests themselves | 20–70ms |

Editing a microflow and seeing straight away whether it still passes is the loop
this exists for. Ctrl-C stops watching and restores the project — the shutdown
prints `project restored` when it has.

Adding, editing and deleting tests all work mid-session: the suite is re-parsed
on every change, and a deleted test's microflow is dropped rather than left
behind reporting a stale pass.

`--watch` requires `--local`. The Docker and `--legacy-runner` paths can only
re-run tests by restarting, which is the thing being avoided.

#### `--attach`: no boot at all

If you already have the app running, tests can skip the boot entirely. The dev
loop has to opt into hosting the endpoint, because the handler is registered by
the after-startup microflow and so cannot be added to an app that is already up:

```bash
# terminal 1 — the app you are working in
mxcli run --local --test-endpoint -p app.mpr

# terminal 2 — runs in ~2s, no boot, repeatable
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --attach
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --attach --watch    # ...and re-run on every change
```

The hosting app chains your project's own after-startup microflow rather than
displacing it, so it still boots normally. The endpoint and the handshake file
(`.mxcli/test-endpoint.json`, mode 0600) are removed when the app stops.

Three things to know before reaching for it:

- **Tests run against the running app's database**, not a scratch one, so they
  can leave data behind in the app you are looking at. `--local` uses a separate
  `<project>_test` database; `--attach` does not.
- **An attach only owns its own test microflows.** The endpoint and the
  after-startup setting belong to the app hosting them, and cleanup never
  touches them.
- **A change needing a runtime restart is refused** — a new entity or
  association. That runtime belongs to the other process. Restart it, or drop
  `--attach`.

| | Boot | Database | Owns the runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--local` | ~30s each run | `<project>_test` | yes |
| `--local --watch` | ~30s once, then ~2s | `<project>_test` | yes |
| `--attach` | none | the running app's | no |

#### Security of the endpoint

It executes microflows under a system context, so it is gated four ways:

| Guard | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No `MXCLI_TEST_TOKEN` in the runtime's environment | The handler is **not registered at all** (404) |
| Missing or wrong `X-MxTest-Token` header | 401, compared in constant time |
| Non-loopback caller | 403 |
| `mf` outside `MxTest.Test_*` | 403 — it is not a general microflow-invocation API |

The token is generated per run and reaches the runtime through its **environment**,
never written into the project. Combined with fail-closed registration, that means
a project which kept the `MxTest` module through a failed cleanup exposes nothing
when deployed anywhere else.

### Docker: the after-startup microflow

1. Parses test files and extracts test blocks with annotations
2. Records the project's current after-startup microflow, and whether an `MxTest`
   module already exists
3. Generates a single `MxTest.TestRunner` microflow containing every test, and
   points after-startup at it
4. Builds the project and restarts the container
5. Captures structured `MXTEST:` log lines for pass/fail
6. Restores the original after-startup setting and removes the generated runner —
   the whole `MxTest` module when the runner created it, otherwise just the
   `TestRunner` microflow
7. Outputs results (console, JUnit XML)

### Both mechanisms

The project's **Security Level is not modified**. The after-startup microflow runs
in an administrative context and is not subject to it, and forcing it off breaks
projects whose published REST/OData services use custom authentication. If a
cleanup step fails the run reports an error and names what was left changed —
the project is modified, so it must not read as a clean pass.

## Writing Good Tests

### Test a Single Behavior

Each test block should test one thing:

```sql
/**
 * @test Discount applied for orders over 100
 * @expect $result = 90.0
 */
$result = call microflow Sales.CalculateDiscount(OrderTotal = 100.0);
/
```

### Test Multiple Scenarios

Use separate blocks for different input values:

```sql
/**
 * @test Negative value returns 'negative'
 * @expect $result = 'negative'
 */
$result = call microflow MyModule.Classify(value = -5);
/

/**
 * @test Zero returns 'zero'
 * @expect $result = 'zero'
 */
$result = call microflow MyModule.Classify(value = 0);
/

/**
 * @test Positive value returns 'positive'
 * @expect $result = 'positive'
 */
$result = call microflow MyModule.Classify(value = 42);
/
```

### Test Entity Operations

Tests can create, modify, and verify entities:

```sql
/**
 * @test Create and update product
 * @expect $updated = true
 */
$product = call microflow Sales.CreateProduct(
  Name = 'Widget', Code = 'W-001'
);
commit $product;
$updated = call microflow Sales.UpdateProduct(
  Product = $product, NewName = 'Super Widget'
);
/
```

### Test Error Handling

Use `@throws` to verify that a microflow raises an error:

```sql
/**
 * @test Invalid input throws validation error
 * @throws 'Validation failed'
 */
call microflow Sales.ValidateOrder(Total = -1);
/
```

---

## Test File Organization

Recommended structure:

```
tests/
├── microflows.test.mdl      # business logic tests
├── entities.test.mdl         # entity CRUD tests
├── validation.test.mdl       # validation tests
└── specs/
    └── sales-module.test.md  # Markdown specification
```

---

## Interpreting Failures

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Exception during execution` | Microflow threw a runtime error | Check BSON structure, entity references, attribute types |
| `Expected $result = 'X' but got 'Y'` | Wrong return value | Fix microflow logic |
| `Test was not executed` | Runtime crashed before reaching it | Check earlier test failures or runtime logs |
| `after startup microflow should return a boolean` | Generated runner has wrong return type | Report as bug in mxcli |

---

## CI Integration

Use `--junit` to produce JUnit XML for CI systems:

```bash
mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --junit test-results.xml
```

The JUnit XML works with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, etc.

```yaml
# GitHub actions example
- name: run microflow tests
  run: mxcli test tests/ -p app.mpr --junit test-results.xml
- name: publish test results
  uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1
  with:
    name: microflow Tests
    path: test-results.xml
    reporter: java-junit
```
